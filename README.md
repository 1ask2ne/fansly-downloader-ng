## üëã Introducing ``Fansly Scraper``
Easy to use Fansly Downloader for Videos and Photos from your favorite fansly creators. After you've launched the program, it'll create a folder named ``CreatorName_fansly`` in the same directory you launched it from. That folder will contain the content downloaded in the highest resolution possible. It will also be sorted depending on your [configuration settings](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#4-configini).
This is pretty useful for example; if you dislike the website theming and would like to view the media on your local machine instead. This code does not bypass any paywalls & no end user information is collected during usage.

## üèóÔ∏è Set up
You can just install the [Executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/releases/latest), skip the entire set up section & go to [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App#-quick-start)

#### Requirements
If you want to use the python source directly, please install following requirements into your environment:

	pip install requests loguru imagehash pillow python-dateutil psutil keyboard "undetected_chromedriver==3.4.6" pycryptodome av m3u8 pywin32
or you can use [``requirements.txt``](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/blob/main/requirements.txt) with ``pip install --user -r requirements.txt`` into ``cmd.exe`` from project download folder to install them.

If you get an error while installing requirements with ``pywin32``; it is a windows only library and is not definitely required for the scraper itself. Only ``automatic_configurator.py`` needs it. If for some reason you can't install it with pip, you can also install it [through pywin32's github](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases) or you might also be able to install that by ``pip install pypiwin32`` or ``conda install pywin32``. If you can't install pywin32 that obviously means that you won't be able to run automatic configurator and need to use [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/wiki/Get-Started) instead to set it up.

## üöÄ Quick Start
**Quick start is only compatible with Windows & you have to have recently logged into fansly in any of the following browsers: Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Brave or Microsoft Edge and that browser has to be [set as your default browser in windows settings](https://www.avast.com/c-change-default-browser-windows#:~:text=Open%20the%20Start%20menu%20and,is%20the%20current%20default%20browser.).**
1. Make sure the browser you set as default browser [in windows settings](https://www.avast.com/c-change-default-browser-windows#:~:text=Open%20the%20Start%20menu%20and,is%20the%20current%20default%20browser.), is also the browser that you've browsed fansly with in the past
2. Click on Automatic Configurator and wait for it [to do its thing](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#2-automatic-configurator)
3. If it was successful(``config.ini`` should now *only* show a *single* ``ReplaceMe`` the targeted creator name) open the ``config.ini`` file and replace the value for ``[TargetedCreator]`` > ``Username =`` with whatever content creator you wish to have scraped
4. Save the ``config.ini`` file(into the same directory as fansly scraper) with the changes you've done to it, close it & then start up Fansly Scraper by clicking on it

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you are not using Windows or are encountering a bug with quick start please head over to [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/wiki/Get-Started) instead ‚ö†Ô∏è**

After completing any of the configuration tutorials [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App#-quick-start) / [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/wiki/Get-Started); in the future you'll only need to change the creator name for Targeted Creator > Username in ``config.ini`` for every further use case on other creators.

## ü§î FAQ
Do you have any unanswered questions or want to know more about fansly scraper? Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/wiki)

+ **Q**: "Why do some executables show detections on them in VirusTotal?"
**A**: They are false positives (invalid detections). I literally e-mail each release of the scraper, for manual analysis to antivirus providers and the not üí© providers actually analyse and unflag them, while others don't even bother reading their e-mails, but for some reason managed to get on VirusTotals file scanning system.

+ **Q**: "Could you add X feature or do X change?"
**A**: Star the project and I'll think about it. Otherwise you could always [open a pull request](https://github.com/Avnsx/Fansly-Downloader-App/pulls)
