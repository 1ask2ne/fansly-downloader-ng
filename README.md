## Description:
On click code, to scrape your favorite fansly creators media content. After you've ran the code, it'll create a folder named ``CreatorName_fansly`` in the same directory you launched the code from. That folder will have two sub-folders called Pictures & Videos, which will contain the downloaded content sorted into them.
This is pretty useful for example; if you dislike the website theming and would like to view the media on your local machine instead. This code does not bypass any paywalls & no end user information is collected during usage.

## Installation
You can just install the [Executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/releases/latest), skip the entire installation section & go to [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly#quick-start)

#### Requirements
	pip install requests loguru imagehash pillow python-dateutil psutil keyboard selenium-wire undetected_chromedriver==3.0.6 pycryptodome pywin32
or you can use [``requirements.txt``](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/blob/main/requirements.txt) to install the requirements above.

If you get an error while installing requirements with ``pywin32``; it is a windows only library and is not definitely required for the scraper itsself. Only ``automatic_configurator.py`` needs it. If for some reason you can't install it with pip, you can also install it [through pywin32's github](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases) or you might also be able to install that by ``pip install pypiwin32`` or ``conda install pywin32``

## Quick Start
**Quick start is only compatible with Windows & you to have to have recently logged into fansly in any of the following browsers: Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Brave or Microsoft Edge and one of those browsers has to be set as your default browser in windows settings.**
1. Make sure the browser you set as default browser in windows settings, is also the browser that you've browsed fansly with in the past
2. Click on Automatic Configurator and wait for it [to do its thing](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#2-automatic-configurator)
3. If it was successful(``config.ini`` should now only show a single ``ReplaceMe`` the targeted creator name) open the ``config.ini`` file and replace the value for ``[TargetedCreator]`` > ``Username =`` with whatever content creator you wish to have scraped
4. Save the ``config.ini`` file(into the same directory as fansly scraper) with the changes you've done to it, close it & then start up Fansly Scraper by clicking on it

**!!! If you are using a different OS or are encountering a bug with quick start please head over to [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/wiki/Get-Started) instead !!!**

After completing any of the configuration tutorials [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly#quick-start) / [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/wiki/Get-Started); in the future you'll only need to change the creator name for Targeted Creator > Username in ``config.ini`` for every further use case on other creators.
