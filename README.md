## Many Thanks to all the `Stargazers` who have supported this project with stars(‚≠ê)

[![Stargazers repo roster for @Avnsx/fansly-downloader](https://reporoster.com/stars/Avnsx/fansly-downloader)](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/stargazers)

## üèóÔ∏è Set up
On windows you can just install the [Executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/releases/latest), skip the entire set up section & go to [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#-quick-start)

#### Requirements
If you intend to use the Python source directly, please ensure that [Python is installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system. Once Python is installed, you can proceed by installing the following requirements using [Python's package manager](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) within your systems terminal type:

	pip install requests loguru imagehash pillow python-dateutil psutil keyboard av m3u8 pycryptodome "undetected_chromedriver==3.4.6" "pywin32; platform_system == 'Windows'"
Alternatively you can use [``requirements.txt``](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/blob/main/requirements.txt) through opening your system's terminal (e.g.: cmd.exe) and navigating to the project's download folder & executing the following command: ``pip install --user -r requirements.txt``

If you are on windows and can't install the windows only library called ``pywin32`` with pip, you can also install it [through pywin32's github](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases). Not being able to install pywin32, means that you won't be able to run automatic configurator and need to use [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Get-Started) instead to set Fansly Downloader up.

## üöÄ Quick Start
**Quick start is only compatible with Windows & you have to have recently logged into fansly in any of the following browsers: Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Brave or Microsoft Edge and that browser has to be [set as your default browser in windows settings](https://www.avast.com/c-change-default-browser-windows#:~:text=Open%20the%20Start%20menu%20and,is%20the%20current%20default%20browser).**

1. Make sure the browser you set as default browser [in windows settings](https://www.avast.com/c-change-default-browser-windows#:~:text=Open%20the%20Start%20menu%20and,is%20the%20current%20default%20browser), is also the browser that you've browsed fansly with in the past
2. Click on Automatic Configurator and wait for it [to do its thing](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#2-automatic-configurator)
3. If it was successful(``config.ini`` should now *only* show a *single* ``ReplaceMe`` the targeted creator name) open the ``config.ini`` file and replace the value for ``[TargetedCreator]`` > ``Username =`` with whatever content creator you wish to have scraped
4. Save the ``config.ini`` file(into the same directory as Fansly Downloader) with the changes you've done to it, close it & then start up Fansly Downloader by clicking on it

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you are not using Windows or are encountering a bug with quick start please head over to [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Get-Started) instead ‚ö†Ô∏è**

After completing any of the configuration tutorials [Quick Start](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader#-quick-start) / [Get Started](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki/Get-Started); in the future you'll only need to change the creator name for Targeted Creator > Username in ``config.ini`` for every further use case on other creators.

## ü§î FAQ
Do you have any unanswered questions or want to know more about Fansly Downloader? Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/wiki) or check if your topic was mentioned in [Discussions](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/discussions) or [Issues](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/issues)

+ **Q**: "Why do some executables show detections on them in VirusTotal?"
**A**: They are false positives (invalid detections). I literally e-mail each release of the scraper, for manual analysis to antivirus providers and the not üí© providers actually analyse and unflag them, while others don't even bother reading their e-mails, but for some reason managed to get on VirusTotals file scanning system.

+ **Q**: "Could you add X feature or do X change?"
**A**: Star the project and I'll think about it. Otherwise you could always [open a pull request](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader/pulls)

+ **Q**: "Will you add any payment bypassing features to Fansly Downloader?"
**A**: No, as the intention of this repository is not to harm fansly
