![GitHub Banner](https://i.imgur.com/CT4B17a.png)
## Description
On click code, to scrape your favorite fansly creators media content. After you've ran the code, it'll create a folder named ``CreatorName_fansly`` in the same directory you launched the code from. That folder will have two sub-folders called Pictures & Videos, which will contain the downloaded content sorted into them.
This is pretty usefull for example; if you dislike the website theming, but would like to view the media on your local machine instead.

## How To
1. If you don't want to use the executeable version [Soon], download the GitHub repo
2. Go to whatever creators account page and open your browsers developer console (Most often Key: F12)
3. Reload the website by using the rotating arrow symbol to the left of your browsers search bar, while the developer console is open. Do the steps on the picture:

5. Now paste both of the strings - that were on the right side of ``authorization:`` & ``User-Agent:`` - which you just copied, as shown in the picture above. Into the configuration file (config.ini) and replace the two strings with their coressponding values. (1. ``[MyAccount]`` > ``Authorization_Token=`` paste the value for ``authorization:``; 2. ``[MyAccount]`` > ``User_Agent=`` paste the value for ``User-Agent:``.
6. Replace the value for ``[TargetedCreator]`` > ``Username=`` with whatever content creator you wish.
7. Save the file & then start up ``fansly_scraper.py``

## Installation
You can just install the executable file from the releases section on the right side on the github section. [Soon]
Else you'll need to install python and the dependencies below through python.

## Dependencies
If you are using the raw source, paste below in cmd:

	pip install requests

Dependant on how many people show me that they're liking the code by giving ‚≠ê's on this repo, I'll expand functionality & push more quality of life updates.
