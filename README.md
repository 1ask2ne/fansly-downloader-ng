## Description
On click code, to scrape your favorite fansly creators media content. After you've ran the code, it'll create a folder named ``CreatorName_fansly`` in the same directory you launched the code from. That folder will have two sub-folders called Pictures & Videos, which will contain the downloaded content sorted into them.
This is pretty useful for example; if you dislike the website theming and would like to view the media on your local machine instead. This code does not bypass any paywalls & no end user information is collected during usage.

## How To
1. If you have Python installed download the GitHub repository, else use the [Executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/releases)
2. Make sure you have registered an account on fansly and are logged in with it in your browser or you'll not be able to get a authorization token from Developer Console.
3. Go to whatever creators account page and open your browsers developer console (Most often Key: F12)
4. Reload the website by using the rotating arrow symbol to the left of your browsers search bar(Key: F5), while the developer console is open. Now do the steps on the following picture:

6. Now paste both of the strings - that were on the right side of ``authorization:`` & ``User-Agent:`` - which you just copied, as shown in the picture above. Into the configuration file (config.ini) and replace the two strings with their corresponding values. (1. ``[MyAccount]`` > ``Authorization_Token=`` paste the value for ``authorization:``; 2. ``[MyAccount]`` > ``User_Agent=`` paste the value for ``User-Agent:``.
7. Replace the value for ``[TargetedCreator]`` > ``Username=`` with whatever content creator you wish.
8. Save the ``config.ini`` file with the changes you've done to it, close it & then start up fansly scraper.

From now on, you'll only need to re-do step 6 for every future use case.

## Installation
You can just install the [Executable version](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly/releases).

Dependant on how many people show me that they're liking the code by giving ‚≠ê's on this repo, I'll expand functionality & push more quality of life updates.
